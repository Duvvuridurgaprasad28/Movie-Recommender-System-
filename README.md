# Movie Recommender System with Live Posters

This project is a content-based movie recommender system that suggests movies similar to a selected movie using metadata features and cosine similarity. The recommendations are enhanced with live movie posters fetched dynamically from the TMDB API, all presented via a Streamlit web app.

---

## Demo

🎬 Explore movie recommendations with posters in an interactive UI.

---

## Features

- **Content-based filtering** using movie tags derived from genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview.
- **Text preprocessing** including tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization.
- **Similarity computation** using cosine similarity.
- **Live fetching** of movie posters using TMDB API.
- **User-friendly interface** built with Streamlit.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Duvvuridurgaprasad28/Movie-Recommender-System-.git
cd Movie-Recommender-System-
````

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate     # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure API key**

Add your TMDB API key in `src/app.py` (replace placeholder):

```python
TMDB_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

Sign up here: [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

5. **Run the pipeline**

Use DVC to reproduce pipeline stages:

```bash
dvc repro
```

Or run stages manually:

```bash
python src/components/data_ingestion.py
python src/components/feature_engineering.py
python src/components/model_trainer.py
```

6. **Launch Streamlit app**

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```
